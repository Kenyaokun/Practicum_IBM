Some datasets choices (>500 samples):
1. Lung Adenocarcinoma (MSKCC, 2020) 604 samples (there is a 2021 version, but the columns are quite different from each other and can not be merged to one large dataset)
2. Lung Adenocarcinoma (TCGA, Firehose Legacy) 586 samples
3. Lung Adenocarcinoma (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas) 566 samples
4. Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas) 487 samples 
5. I tried to merge 2&3 dataset, because they have amlost the same columns, but the preprocessing came across some problems, I do not know whether the dataset could be used after I clean them.
6. Pan-Lung Cancer (TCGA, Nat Genet 2016) 1144 samples
7. Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (TCGA, Firehose Legacy) 511 samples
